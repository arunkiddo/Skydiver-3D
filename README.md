# Skydiver-3D
My first attempt at a 3D video game using libgdx.

This was my first time using 3D graphics and my first time making a video game. I chose to use libgdx for this project since its framework allows programs to be run on the desktop, web, Android, and iOS using the same code. Since the program can be easily run on the desktop, it is possible to test and debug the user interface without using Android. Although the game is mostly completed, I still must fix memory bugs on Android that cause the game to load extremely slowly and have poor frame rate when I test it on my phone.

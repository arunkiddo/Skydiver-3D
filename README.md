# Skydiver-3D

This was my first time using 3D graphics and my first time making a video game. I chose to use libgdx for this project since its framework allows programs to be run on the desktop, web, Android, and iOS using the same code. Since the program can be easily run on the desktop, it is possible to test and debug the user interface without using Android. The game is mostly complete and will be released on the Google Play Store by June 20.

This project uses the Gradle build system. It can be imported in Eclipse by cloning the root directory into your local repository, choosing File->Import->Gradle->Gradle Project, then inputting the path of this project into the next dialogue.
